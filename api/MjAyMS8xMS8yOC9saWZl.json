After calculation, I discovered that people with higher BMI, a country with a lower mortality rate, tend to have a high life expectancy. What’s more, income and schooling also strongly correlate with life expectancy.<br>\nI also found that government expenditure and GDP don’t strongly correlate with life expectancy. I primarily considered alcohol a trigger to a shorter life, but the result converted my thoughts. I would love to suggest countries focus more on increasing the overall income of their residents rather than weigh too much on government expenditure and GDP.<br>\nThere are still many flaws and shortcomings in this survey. The overall statistics pool is narrow, more samples can help dig deeper into this topic.<br>\nIn a nutshell, I hope these findings would be helpful in some ways.</p>\n<hr>\n","prev":{"title":"Story telling on Disney+ (Baby Yoda version)","link":"2021/12/05/st"},"next":{"title":"Conventional Report on Disney+","link":"2021/11/25/disney"},"plink":"http://example.com/2021/11/28/life/","toc":[{"id":"dataset-details","title":"Dataset Details","index":"1"},{"id":"objectives","title":"Objectives","index":"2"},{"id":"notice","title":"Notice","index":"3"},{"id":"conclusion","title":"Conclusion","index":"4"}],"reading_time":"421 words in 3 min"}
