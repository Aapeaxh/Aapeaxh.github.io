I volunteered in professional events like China-CEEC Arts Cooperation Forum and daily events like Mayday “Just Rock It,” Bird’s Nest Concert, and Earth Day Festival. I enjoy my time most when I’m accompanying the elderly and children. It’s an honor to help the world in return.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/v1.jpg\" alt=\"volunteer1\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nHospital Guidance Volunteer in Beijing | 2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/v2.jpg\" alt=\"volunteer2\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nAccompany Autistic children | 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/v3.jpg\" alt=\"volunteer3\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nAccompany the elderly with Alzheimer’s disease | 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/sb1.jpg\" alt=\"volunteer4\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nSanta Barbara Earth Day Festival | 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/heart.jpg\" alt=\"volunteer5\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nAmerican Heart Association Heart Saver Volunteer | 2019</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"debate\">Debate<a title=\"#debate\" href=\"#debate\"></a></h2>\n<p>I joined the English debate team back in high school. I enjoyed cooperating with others and considering social issues rationally and statistically.<br>\n<img src=\"images/private/deb1.jpg\" alt=\"debate\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nNational Speech and Debate Association（NSDA in China) | 2014</p>\n<p>I joined the university’s Chinese debate team after college (since there was no English debate team back then). I was so lucky to make many friends by preparing for the debate competition and meeting them during the debate. Some of us became best friends even till now. Though friendship always comes first, it’s glad to know we also won a lot of awards at the same time.<br>\n<img src=\"images/private/deb2.jpg\" alt=\"debate2\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"dance-&amp;-sing\">Dance &amp; Sing<a title=\"#dance-&amp;-sing\" href=\"#dance-&amp;-sing\"></a></h2>\n<p>I have been learning Chinese classical dance and modern dance since 6-year-old. Later, I fell in love with KPOP. While learning dance by myself, I also recorded and posted dance tutorial videos online.<br>\n<img src=\"images/private/dance1.jpg\" alt=\"dance\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\n<img src=\"images/private/dance2.jpg\" alt=\"dance2\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"photography\">Photography<a title=\"#photography\" href=\"#photography\"></a></h2>\n<p>I took professional photography courses during my undergraduate studies. Planning and shooting media news, micro-film or documentary is also part of my daily life. I truly enjoyed recording the world around me using my camera. My affection for video can be also seen from my love for dramas on streaming apps (like Disney+ and Netflix). I hope one day I can work in my dream companies.<br>\n<img src=\"images/private/hh1.jpg\" alt=\"photography2\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\n<img src=\"images/private/hh2.jpg\" alt=\"photography3\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nLandscape Photography | 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/HC02.jpg\" alt=\"photography2\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\n<img src=\"images/private/HC03.jpg\" alt=\"photography3\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nPortrait Photography | 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/private/photo.jpg\" alt=\"photography\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\nHann as the Live TV Host | 2018</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"instrument\">Instrument<a title=\"#instrument\" href=\"#instrument\"></a></h2>\n<p>I began learning the piano when 6-year-old.
